It will cover user registration, authentication, fuel selection, dispensation control, payment processing, and monitoring. The system will integrate with existing infrastructure at the petrol/gas station and adhere to relevant regulations and standards.

**1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations:**

- SRS: Software Requirements Specification
- GUI: Graphical User Interface
- API: Application Programming Interface
- RFID: Radio-Frequency Identification
- POS: Point of Sale

**1.4 References:**
List any relevant documents or standards referenced in this SRS.

**2. Overall Description**

**2.1 Product Perspective:**
The automated petrol/gas dispensation system will interface with existing petrol/gas pumps, payment terminals, and backend systems at the petrol/gas station. It will be a standalone system but will integrate seamlessly with the station's infrastructure.

**2.2 Product Functions:**

- User Registration and Authentication
- Fuel Selection and Dispensation Control
- Payment Processing
- Transaction Monitoring and Reporting

**2.3 User Classes and Characteristics:**
The system will serve two primary user classes: customers and station attendants. Customers will interact with the system to dispense petrol/gas and make payments, while station attendants will have administrative privileges for monitoring and managing transactions.

**2.4 Operating Environment:**
The system will operate in a petrol/gas station environment, subject to varying weather conditions and traffic levels. It must be robust and reliable to handle continuous usage throughout the day.

**2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints:**
The system must comply with regulatory requirements for petrol/gas dispensation, including safety standards and measurement accuracy. It should also be scalable to accommodate future enhancements and integrations.

**2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies:**
The system assumes reliable internet connectivity for real-time transaction processing. It depends on the availability of compatible hardware components, such as petrol/gas pumps with electronic control systems.

**3. Specific Requirements**

- Dispensation will stop automatically when the desired quantity is reached or manually by the customer.

**3.2.3 Payment Processing:**
- Customers can choose from various payment methods, including credit/debit cards, mobile wallets, and cash.
- The system will securely process payment transactions in real-time, generating electronic receipts for customers.

**3.2.4 Monitoring and Reporting:**
- Station attendants can monitor transaction logs and generate reports through administrative interfaces.
- The system will record transaction details, including fuel dispensed, payment method, and timestamp, for auditing purposes.

**3.3 Performance Requirements**

**3.3.1 Response Time:**
- The system should respond to user inputs within milliseconds to provide a seamless experience.
- Fuel dispensation should commence promptly upon customer selection.

**3.3.2 Throughput:**
- The system should handle multiple concurrent transactions during peak hours without significant performance degradation.
- Petrol/gas pumps should dispense fuel at the specified flow rate to optimize throughput.

**3.3.3 Capacity:**
- The system should support a large number of registered vehicles and payment methods without affecting performance.
- Transaction logs and reports should be stored efficiently to accommodate long-term usage.

**3.4 Security Requirements**

**3.4.1 Data Security:**
- Customer data, including personal information and payment details, should be encrypted during transmission and storage.
- Access to sensitive data should be restricted based on user roles and privileges.

**3.4.2 Access Control:**
- User authentication mechanisms should prevent unauthorized access to the system.
- Administrative interfaces should require additional authentication for privileged operations.

**3.4.3 Payment Security:**
- Payment transactions should comply with PCI DSS standards to ensure cardholder data security.
- Tokenization and encryption should be used to protect payment information from unauthorized access.

**3.5 Software Quality Attributes**

**3.5.1 Reliability:**
- The system should operate reliably under normal and abnormal conditions, minimizing downtime and service disruptions.
- Fault-tolerance mechanisms should be implemented to handle hardware and software failures gracefully.

**3.5.2 Usability:**
